# Create_custom_Portfolio

This repo will create a custom portfolio after reading in csv data which consist of a number of Tickers.

## Clean & Tidy Dataframes
After reading in our data into a dataframe we need to be sure no values are missing if there are nulls present then we proceed to drop missing values.

# Plotting and Drawing Conclusions

We then performed quantative analysis (things calculated: _Standard_ _Deviation_, _Rolling_ _Statistics_, _Covariance_, _Variance_, _Beta_, _Correlation_) on the joined table we created from the ticker data we read in earlier.

## Our Portfolio & Our Quantative Analysis
Lastly we'll create our own custom portfolio and compare it's quantative analysis to that of the rest of the portfolios/stocks we've worked with.

# Conclusion
A brief description of what I concluded from the experiment.
